        <h3 class="underlined-title">MINOXIDIL 5% SOLUTION</h3>
        <p class="text-s-red">WHAT IS IT?</p>
        <p>Minoxidil is a topical, liquid solution that you apply to your scalp twice daily. Once you start using minoxidil, it requires continued use in order to see continued results.</p>
        <p class="text-s-red">WHAT DOES IT DO?</p>
        <p>Minoxidil creates the ideal conditions for hair growth in your scalp by increasing blood flow to your scalp and hair follicles. This topical solution slows down hair loss and encourages the hair you do have to grow in thicker and stronger, which can make a huge difference in how thinning hair looks. Minoxidil works best for hair growth on the crown and vertex of your head. Unfortunately, it will not stimulate growth on a receding hairline and is not recommended for use on anywhere other than the crown (top) of your head.</p>
        <p class="text-s-red">HOW SOON WILL I SEE RESULTS?</p>
        <p>It will take 3-4 months of consistent application before you notice improvements. You may notice an increase in shedding in the first month of use, this is normal and should slow after the first month. Some people also see changes in hair color or texture after use. If you do not see results within 4-6 months of use, cosider discontinuing and consulting your doctor.</p>

        <p class="text-s-red">WHAT IS DHT?</p>
        <p>DHT stands for Dihydrotestosterone, a male sex hormone which is made from testosterone. DHT affects those genetically prone to male pattern baldness by binding to receptors in the scalp and causes hair follicles to miniaturize (shrink and weaken) and eventually stop growing hair at all.</p>
        <p class="text-s-red">WHAT DOES A DHT BLOCKER DO?</p>
        <p>The specific form of a DHT blocker in the Matte Hair Cream is a topical formula with serenoa serrulata fruit extract, which helps encourage hair growth. Serenoa serrulata fruit extract has the potential to lower the conversion of testosterone to DHT and reduce the DHT levels in the scalp. Putting it in a styling product is a great way to add it to your daily routine without having to think about it too much.</p>

        <h3 class="underlined-title">THICKENING SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER W/ NIACINAMIDE</h3>
        <p class="text-s-red">WHAT IS NIACINAMIDE?</p>
        <p>Niacinamide, also known as nicotinamide, is a form of Vitamin B3 that is beneficial to hair health and can potentially speed up the rate of hair regrowth seen in combination with minoxidil and a DHT blocker. Niacinamide is also thought to restore damaged hair and increase body and suppleness of hair for the appearance of thicker locks.</p>
        <p class="text-s-red">WHAT OTHER BENEFICIAL INGREDIENTS ARE IN HERE?</p>
        <p>Both our Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner contain niacinamide as well as other ingredients that are popular in hair loss shampoos for their hair growth benefits.</p>
        <p><span class="text-s-red">ROSEMARY OIL </span> - Found in both our Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner, rosemary oil has been commonly used to promote hair groth similar to minoxidil.</p>
        <p><span class="text-s-red">PANTHENOL </span> - Found in our Thickening Shampoo is believed to have benefits for hair thickness and moisture retention.</p>
        <p><span class="text-s-red">ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE </span> - Found in our Thickening Shampoo, aloe may help promote a healthy scalp and help condition and repair damaged hair.</p>
        <p><span class="text-s-red">BIOTIN </span> - Found in our Thickening Conditioner, is a form of Vitamin B. While there is little known about the effects of biotihn on hair growth, a biotin deficiency is known to lead to hair loss, indicating it is important to your hair health.</p>
        <p><span class="text-s-red">CAFFEINE </span> - Found in our Thickening Conditioner, caffeine has been shown to extend the growth phase of hair follicles and works well in combination with minoxidil and or DHT blockers.</p>
        <p class="text-s-red">HOW SOON WILL I SEE RESULTS?</p>
        <p>Using this Thickening Shampoo & Conditioner in conjunction with minoxidil and a DHT blocker is the best way to see results, especially around the hairline, which isn't typically helped by minoxidil or DHT blockers. Results typically take 4-6 months to see.</p>
