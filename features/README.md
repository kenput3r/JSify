## Deal Tagging
This feature does not enable the discount, but rather labels the product as having a discount. This label is applied to both the product page and product tiles.

BOGO: Add the tag BOGO to products that have a buy one get one sale running. This tag will add the BOGO label as well as force the customer to add products to cart in increments of 2.

Percent Off: Add the tag XXPERCENTOFF where XX is the the percentage (example 20PERCENTOFF) to show the discount on both the Product Page and Product Tile.
